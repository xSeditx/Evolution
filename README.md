# Evolution 

An Evolution simulator complete with AI and a form of Neural Network that I designed which bases the creatures movements on a probability system with higher or lower probabilities of performing various actions depended on what they either collided with or see. 


The Network contains Values for every action the creature may perform, If it sees an enemy for instance its network holds a Percentage number of how often to go... Forward, Backwards, Turn Left, Turn Right, or nothing at all...

It can see MATES, ENEMYS, WALLS, or FOOD.... Each of these Carries A possible Action of the Above type. 

Overtime Those which perform the better of options breeds more just like evolution, Those more fit carry their DNA faster and further. The Offspring Carry the same Weights as their parents with slight mutation rate. Larger Mutations are less common but totally change every weight in the creature, Most of the time just like in Nature these usually die quickly but every now and then a better species takes over.
